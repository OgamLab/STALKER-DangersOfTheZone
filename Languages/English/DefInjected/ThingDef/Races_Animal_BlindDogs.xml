  <BlindDog.description>Lone canines aren't that dangerous, but packs of them are a real pain in the ass. They only attack if they're hungry... the bad thing is, they're almost always hungry. If you're up against a whole pack, try to pick them off from a high spot, else they'll just run you over.</BlindDog.description>
